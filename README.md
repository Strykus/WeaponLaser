# How to use!

 Remove comment "//" inside file "hitscan_weapon_laser.txt or projectile_weapon_laser.txt" in front of color that you want(or change name after "first_" that already
 active) to use, and then save the file and reload the game.
  Change color size after color name: 5,10,20,30,40  example: CH_grenade_arc_proto_path_first_golden_20
 Values without numbers at the end have size: _path_first_<your color> is 16 _path_<your color> is 32
 rgb have 5,10,30,40 and 20 is default
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Or when in lobby type command in console: sv_cheats 1; weapon_reparse; reload_mods; sv_cheats 0
 You can bind this command to any button by typing: bind f3 "sv_cheats 1; weapon_reparse; reload_mods; sv_cheats 0"
