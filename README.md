Want to ask me something? feel free to dm in my discord: Avalar#2742

v1.0 - Release version. 
- Working as intended, can be applied on non hitscan weapons like Kraber,Wingman Elite, Double take but projectile will be broke


v2.0 - Color Update
- Added More Color variations : blue; cyan; golden; green; magenta; orange; purple; pink; red.
- Can be changed it "hitscan_weapon_laser.txt" and "projectile_weapon_laser.txt"

 Remove comment "//" inside file "hitscan_weapon_laser.txt or projectile_weapon_laser.txt" in front of color that you want(or change name after "first_" that already
 active) to use, and then save the file and reload the game.
 Or when in lobby type command in console: sv_cheats 1; weapon_reparse; reload_mods; sv_cheats 0
 You can bind this command to any button by typing: bind f3 "sv_cheats 1; weapon_reparse; reload_mods; sv_cheats 0"
